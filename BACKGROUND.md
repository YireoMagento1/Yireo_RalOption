Each Magento product can have Custom Options. By setting the Custom Option to type RalOption Color, you can easily convert a simple text-box to become a color-picker. Customers can select the right product-color using a modifyable modal-box (Lightbox).

Through the RALCODE-tag you can also choose which color is picked by default. The color-picker is based on a pallette-file that can easily be overridden. To the pallette, you can also add a simple pricing rule: A specific color can be 1 Euro more or less, relative to the normal product-price - or the option-price can be defined as a fixed price of a percentage of the original.
